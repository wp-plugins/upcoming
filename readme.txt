== Description ==
Easily create a list of your upcoming events on your blog, completely templatable, either in a post or page, or in a widget!

Example: [Joost de Valk's Speaking Page](http://yoast.com/speaking/)

More info:

* More info on [Upcoming](http://yoast.com/wordpress/upcoming/).
* Check out the other [Wordpress plugins](http://yoast.com/wordpress/) by the same author.

To get the same effect with the conferences you're speaking add, tag these events with speaker:username, and add the following CSS to your stylesheet:

`tr.speaking td h4 {
	background: url(/wp-content/plugins/upcoming/microphone.png) no-repeat left top;
	padding-left: 30px;
}`

The microphone icon that comes with the plugin is &copy; [Everaldo Coelho](http://www.everaldo.com/), licensed under the LGPL and can be found [here](http://www.iconfinder.net/index.php?q=microphone&page=icondetails&iconid=1846&size=22&q=microphone&s12=on&s16=on&s22=on&s32=on&s48=on&s64=on&s128=on)
